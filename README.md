Insights from my recent Excel Data Analysis Project, where I had the opportunity to thoroughly analyze store data and uncover key business trends. Through a detailed process of data cleaning, analysis, and processing, I created a comprehensive dashboard to visualize crucial metrics and drive informed decision-making. ðŸ“Š
ðŸ“Š Key Metrics Highlighted:
* Orders vs. Sales: The dashboard shows monthly sales trends, with the peak occurring in March (~1.9M) before a gradual decline in the following months.
* Sales by Gender: Women contributed to the majority of sales, accounting for 64%, while men made up 36% of the total sales.
* Order Status: Most orders (92%) were successfully delivered, with 3% each refunded, returned, or canceled.
* Top 5 Regions by Sales: One region led with 2.99M in sales, followed by another at 2.64M, and three more regions contributing significantly to the overall total.
* Order Distribution by Age and Gender: Women in the Adult age group placed the highest percentage of orders (34.59%), while men in the same age group accounted for 15.47%. Both teenage and senior groups were also active contributors.
* Sales Channels: The largest portion of orders came from one channel, contributing 35.48%, followed by another platform at 23.36%, and a third with 21.59%. Other channels made up smaller portions of the total order volume.
ðŸ’¡ Project Highlights: This dashboard provides a dynamic, real-time overview of store performance across various regions, demographics, and channels. The insights gained from the analysis will aid in optimizing inventory, refining marketing strategies, and gaining a deeper understanding of customer behavior.
